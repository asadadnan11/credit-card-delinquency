## Project Overview

So I need to build some credit risk models for this project. The goal is to predict which customers are gonna default on their credit cards/loans and then figure out how to prioritize collections efforts. Pretty straightforward, right? 

**What I'm trying to do:**
- Generate fake data that looks real (because I don't have real data)
- Build models that can predict delinquency risk
- Segment customers into risk groups
- Come up with collections strategies

**Data:** Making up 50k fake customer accounts because that's what the assignment asks for

**Tools:** Python, pandas, sklearn, xgboost, matplotlib (the usual suspects)""",
