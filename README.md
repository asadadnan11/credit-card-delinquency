## Project Overview

Consumer credit delinquency modeling is critical for financial institutions to manage risk and optimize collection resources. This project builds predictive models to identify high-risk customers and develops data-driven collection strategies that can significantly reduce portfolio losses.

Using synthetic data that mirrors real-world credit portfolios, this analysis covers the complete credit risk modeling workflow - from feature engineering through business strategy implementation. The models achieve 85% AUC performance and project a 25% reduction in overdue balances through optimized collections prioritization.

**Key Business Question:** How can we better predict which customers will become delinquent and optimize our collections approach to maximize recovery while minimizing costs?

## Features

### Technical Capabilities
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Created 50,000 realistic consumer credit accounts with logical relationships between risk factors
- **Advanced Modeling**: Implemented both logistic regression (baseline) and XGBoost (advanced) with hyperparameter optimization
- **Model Performance**: Achieved 85% AUC on delinquency prediction, exceeding industry benchmarks
- **Risk Segmentation**: Developed three-tier customer segmentation (Low/Medium/High risk) with differentiated strategies
- **Collections Optimization**: Built framework projecting 25% reduction in overdue balances

### Business Applications
- Risk-based pricing strategy recommendations
- Automated collections workflow design
- Portfolio monitoring and early warning systems
- Resource allocation optimization across risk segments

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
Python 3.7+
Jupyter Notebook
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
xgboost
matplotlib
seaborn
```

### Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-delinquency-modeling.git
cd credit-card-delinquency-modeling
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

3. Launch the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook credit-card-delinquency.ipynb
```

4. Run all cells to reproduce the complete analysis

## Data Generation

The project uses synthetically generated data to simulate a realistic credit card and personal loan portfolio:

- **50,000 customer accounts** with diverse characteristics
- **12 key features** including demographics, credit behavior, and payment history
- **Realistic relationships** between variables (e.g., income affects credit limits, utilization impacts delinquency)
- **Missing data simulation** to mirror real-world data challenges

Key variables include credit utilization, payment history scores, income brackets, account types, and current balances - all engineered to reflect actual credit risk patterns.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Missing value handling with median imputation
- Feature encoding for categorical variables
- Train/test splitting with stratification to maintain target balance

### 2. Model Development
- **Baseline Model**: Logistic regression with feature scaling and coefficient analysis
- **Advanced Model**: XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning (n_estimators, max_depth, learning_rate)
- **Evaluation**: ROC-AUC, classification reports, and feature importance analysis

### 3. Risk Segmentation
- Three-tier segmentation based on predicted delinquency probability
- Validation against actual delinquency rates
- Customer distribution and financial impact analysis

### 4. Collections Strategy
- Segment-specific collection approaches
- Resource allocation recommendations (60% high-risk, 30% medium-risk, 10% low-risk)
- ROI projections and recovery rate estimates

## Results & Visualizations

### Model Performance Comparison
The XGBoost model significantly outperformed the baseline logistic regression:

*Figure 1: ROC Curve Comparison - XGBoost achieves 85% AUC compared to logistic regression baseline, demonstrating superior predictive capability for identifying high-risk customers.*

### Risk Segmentation Analysis
Customer segmentation reveals clear risk patterns and actionable insights:

### Key Performance Metrics
- **Model Accuracy**: 85% AUC on test set
- **Portfolio Coverage**: 50,000 synthetic accounts analyzed
- **Projected Impact**: 25% reduction in overdue balances
- **Risk Concentration**: High-risk segment (15% of customers) accounts for 60% of potential losses

## Business Impact

### Strategic Value
This analysis provides financial institutions with a systematic approach to credit risk management that can drive significant business value:

**Risk Assessment**: The 85% AUC model enables proactive identification of customers likely to become delinquent, allowing for early intervention strategies that can prevent losses before they occur.

**Collections Optimization**: The three-tier segmentation framework optimizes resource allocation by focusing intensive efforts on high-risk accounts while automating low-risk customer interactions. This approach projects a 25% reduction in overdue balances.

**Operational Efficiency**: Automated risk scoring reduces manual review time and enables consistent, data-driven decision-making across the collections organization.

### Implementation Benefits
- **Reduced Losses**: Early identification of high-risk customers enables preventive actions
- **Cost Optimization**: Efficient resource allocation across risk segments maximizes ROI
- **Customer Experience**: Differentiated approaches reduce unnecessary contact with low-risk customers
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Systematic, auditable processes support fair lending practices

### Scalability
The framework is designed to scale across different portfolio types and can be adapted for various consumer lending products beyond credit cards and personal loans.

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Data Pipeline**: Modular synthetic data generation with realistic statistical relationships
- **Model Pipeline**: Standardized preprocessing, training, and evaluation workflow
- **Visualization Framework**: Automated chart generation for business reporting
- **Business Logic**: Configurable segmentation rules and collections strategy parameters

### Model Features
The final XGBoost model leverages 12 engineered features with the most predictive being:
1. Payment history score
2. Credit utilization ratio
3. Number of late payments
4. Current account balance
5. Debt-to-income ratio

### Performance Monitoring
Built-in validation checks ensure model performance meets business requirements:
- AUC threshold monitoring (target: 85%)
- Segmentation validation against actual outcomes
- Collections impact tracking

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Modeling
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple algorithms for improved prediction accuracy
- **Time Series Analysis**: Incorporate temporal patterns in payment behavior
- **Deep Learning**: Explore neural networks for complex feature interactions

### Business Applications
- **Real-time Scoring**: Deploy model for live delinquency risk assessment
- **A/B Testing Framework**: Validate collections strategies against control groups
- **Portfolio Simulation**: Monte Carlo analysis for stress testing scenarios

### Data Integration
- **External Data Sources**: Incorporate bureau data, economic indicators, and alternative data
- **Feature Engineering**: Advanced transformations and interaction terms
- **Data Quality**: Automated data validation and anomaly detection
