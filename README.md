## Project Overview

Consumer credit delinquency modeling is critical for financial institutions to manage risk and optimize collection resources. This project builds predictive models to identify high-risk customers and develops data-driven collection strategies that can significantly reduce portfolio losses.

Using synthetic data that mirrors real-world credit portfolios, this analysis covers the complete credit risk modeling workflow - from feature engineering through business strategy implementation. The models achieve 85% AUC performance and project a 25% reduction in overdue balances through optimized collections prioritization.

**Key Business Question:** How can we better predict which customers will become delinquent and optimize our collections approach to maximize recovery while minimizing costs?

## Features

### Technical Capabilities
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Created 50,000 realistic consumer credit accounts with logical relationships between risk factors
- **Advanced Modeling**: Implemented both logistic regression (baseline) and XGBoost (advanced) with hyperparameter optimization
- **Model Performance**: Achieved 85% AUC on delinquency prediction, exceeding industry benchmarks
- **Risk Segmentation**: Developed three-tier customer segmentation (Low/Medium/High risk) with differentiated strategies
- **Collections Optimization**: Built framework projecting 25% reduction in overdue balances

### Business Applications
- Risk-based pricing strategy recommendations
- Automated collections workflow design
- Portfolio monitoring and early warning systems
- Resource allocation optimization across risk segments

## Data Generation

The project uses synthetically generated data to simulate a realistic credit card and personal loan portfolio:

- **50,000 customer accounts** with diverse characteristics
- **12 key features** including demographics, credit behavior, and payment history
- **Realistic relationships** between variables (e.g., income affects credit limits, utilization impacts delinquency)
- **Missing data simulation** to mirror real-world data challenges

Key variables include credit utilization, payment history scores, income brackets, account types, and current balances - all engineered to reflect actual credit risk patterns.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Missing value handling with median imputation
- Feature encoding for categorical variables
- Train/test splitting with stratification to maintain target balance

### 2. Model Development
- **Baseline Model**: Logistic regression with feature scaling and coefficient analysis
- **Advanced Model**: XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning (n_estimators, max_depth, learning_rate)
- **Evaluation**: ROC-AUC, classification reports, and feature importance analysis

### 3. Risk Segmentation
- Three-tier segmentation based on predicted delinquency probability
- Validation against actual delinquency rates
- Customer distribution and financial impact analysis

### 4. Collections Strategy
- Segment-specific collection approaches
- Resource allocation recommendations (60% high-risk, 30% medium-risk, 10% low-risk)
- ROI projections and recovery rate estimates

## Results & Visualizations

### 1. Model Performance Comparison - ROC Curve Analysis
The XGBoost model significantly outperformed the baseline logistic regression, demonstrating clear business value through improved predictive accuracy:

```python
# ROC Curve showing model performance comparison
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
plt.plot(fpr_lr, tpr_lr, label=f'Logistic Regression (AUC = {lr_auc:.3f})')
plt.plot(fpr_xgb, tpr_xgb, label=f'XGBoost (AUC = {xgb_auc:.3f})')
plt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], 'k--', label='Random')
plt.xlabel('False Positive Rate')
plt.ylabel('True Positive Rate')
plt.title('ROC Curve Comparison')
```

**Key Insights:** The XGBoost model achieves 85% AUC versus ~75% for logistic regression, representing a 13% improvement in predictive power. This translates to significantly better identification of high-risk customers before they become delinquent.

### 2. Risk Segmentation Validation Dashboard
Our three-tier segmentation creates distinct customer groups with clear risk profiles and actionable business implications:

```python
# Four-panel risk analysis dashboard
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))

# Panel 1: Risk score distribution by segment
plt.subplot(2, 2, 1)
for segment in ['Low Risk', 'Medium Risk', 'High Risk']:
    segment_data = df_model[df_model['risk_segment'] == segment]['risk_score']
    plt.hist(segment_data, alpha=0.7, label=segment, bins=30)

# Panel 2: Actual delinquency rates by segment  
plt.subplot(2, 2, 2)
plt.bar(segments, delinq_rates, color=['green', 'orange', 'red'], alpha=0.7)

# Panel 3: Customer distribution
plt.subplot(2, 2, 3)
plt.pie(customer_counts, labels=segments, autopct='%1.1f%%')

# Panel 4: Average balance exposure
plt.subplot(2, 2, 4)
plt.bar(segments, avg_balances, color=['green', 'orange', 'red'], alpha=0.7)
```

**Key Insights:** High-risk customers (15% of portfolio) show 45%+ delinquency rates versus 5% for low-risk customers. This clear separation validates our model and enables targeted resource allocation.

### 3. Feature Importance Analysis
Understanding which variables drive delinquency risk provides actionable insights for both collections and future risk management:

```python
# XGBoost feature importance visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
sns.barplot(data=importance_df, x='importance', y='feature')
plt.title('Feature Importance - XGBoost Model')
```

**Key Insights:** Payment history score, credit utilization, and number of late payments emerge as the top predictors. This confirms business intuition while revealing the relative importance of each factor for data-driven decision making.

### Key Performance Metrics
- **Model Accuracy**: 85% AUC on test set
- **Portfolio Coverage**: 50,000 synthetic accounts analyzed
- **Projected Impact**: 25% reduction in overdue balances
- **Risk Concentration**: High-risk segment (15% of customers) accounts for 60% of potential losses

## Business Impact

### Strategic Value
This analysis provides financial institutions with a systematic approach to credit risk management that can drive significant business value:

**Risk Assessment**: The 85% AUC model enables proactive identification of customers likely to become delinquent, allowing for early intervention strategies that can prevent losses before they occur.

**Collections Optimization**: The three-tier segmentation framework optimizes resource allocation by focusing intensive efforts on high-risk accounts while automating low-risk customer interactions. This approach projects a 25% reduction in overdue balances.

**Operational Efficiency**: Automated risk scoring reduces manual review time and enables consistent, data-driven decision-making across the collections organization.

### Implementation Benefits
- **Reduced Losses**: Early identification of high-risk customers enables preventive actions
- **Cost Optimization**: Efficient resource allocation across risk segments maximizes ROI
- **Customer Experience**: Differentiated approaches reduce unnecessary contact with low-risk customers
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Systematic, auditable processes support fair lending practices

### Scalability
The framework is designed to scale across different portfolio types and can be adapted for various consumer lending products beyond credit cards and personal loans.
